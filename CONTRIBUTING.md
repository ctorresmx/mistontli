# Contributing guidelines

This project follows the standard [`gitflow`](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) process. The only difference is that you should branch off `develop` when working on a new feature, model, etc.

Examples of contributions:

* New features
* New AI models
* Code patches (bugs)
* Documentation improvements

## How to contribute

### Contributing features and patches

If you have any new possible features or a patch (bug), send you pull request.

If you want to start contributing right away, take a look at [open issues](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/labels/stat%3Acontributions%20welcome). If you decide to start on an issue, leave a comment and let other people know that you're working on it.

### Contributing AI models

If you want to contribute with a new AI model, just be sure the rest of AI models still work, i.e., if you needed to alter some functionality for the `Player` or `Game` classes. Document the algorithm used or how to train the model (if it uses training).

### Contributing documentation improvements

If you something catches your eye and needs improvement, please send your pull request right away.


## Coding style

This project follows the PEP8 strictly, except with the 80 characters per row, but we definetely don't go over 120! It also uses 4-space indentation. If you need to add code other than Python, please use the [Google styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for the given language
